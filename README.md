## What is AlgoPro?

AlgoPro is a web-based application that aims to help students practice thier algorithm analysis skills. The student will follow a segment of code line-by-line and annotate the complexity as they go using a drag and drop interface. If students are stuck, hints will be provided to aid them in a given exercise. AlgoPro can also be used by teachers to submit custom exercises and assign them to students. 

## How do I use AlgoPro?

AlgoPro requires a modern browser since it is a web-based application. Since you are reading this right now you most likley already have a compatible device to view this on!
